/// Gear is used as a common denominator for all types of equipment
/// a Hero can own and use. This may be "armor" or "weapon", but we
/// only differentiate the purpose of a piece of Gear by its "slot".
/// 
/// A piece of Gear has these properties:
/// 1) Slot: Where does the Gear fit (i.e. hands, feet, etc.)
/// 2) PowerLevel: Expresses the "power" of the Gear. The higher
/// the PowerLevel, the better the Gear. 
/// 3) Affinity: The world has three kinds of "affinity":
/// Sun, Moon and Stars. The idea is certain places
/// (e.g. dungeons) have an "affinity". If e.g. a Dungeon has
/// the Moon affinity, you can ONLY use Gear with Moon affinity
/// in that particular Dungeon.
/// 4) Description: A description of the Gear, which does not
/// have any functional significance.
